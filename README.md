This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in C++ when iterating and removing elements from a std::vector. The bug arises from modifying the vector while iterating through it using an index-based loop.  The solution demonstrates safe ways to remove elements from the vector without causing unexpected behavior.  The bug is explained in detail within the code comments and shows the impact of the issue and how the suggested solutions provide a fix.
